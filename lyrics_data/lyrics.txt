the first line of 'focus' is 'i know what i came to do and that ain't gonna change' what i came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love to share to listen to improve to learn to share music to share experience to share feelings to make people feel happy and empowered she explained  to make people feel like they're not alone without using my voice to do those things i would feel empty she continued when i say 'focus on me' i'm not asking to be the center of attention i'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice by 'focus on me' i literally mean focus on me focus on what i'm all about and what i believe in  the more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like what we're wearing our gender our hairstyle our sexuality the color of our skin but focus on each other on a soul level the more we realize how much we have in common the more we listen to each other the more one we become  the title of ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her too since she's had such a tumultuous year ahem remember the donut incident but she insists this is about all of us  you judge because you don't focus on me you don't focus on each other she explained you judge because you focus on appearance on clothes you focus on what you want from me what you want from people how you want them to wear their hair you judge me you wanna see me dressed a certain way how you wanna see their makeup their eyebrows you focus on what you think people should be like for you but when you stop and you actually focus on someone you'll see the light in them when you focus on me you see the light in me when we focus on each other we see the light in each other and even if you don't this is who we are what are we making fun of what's there to make fun of we should apologize for that

so the news is out about sam  cat i felt it wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever

being empowered is not the same as being a bitch having something to say is not the same as having a bad attitude  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you i have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because i have come to the realization that i have so much more to talk about i'm currently making the best music i've ever made in my life having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people i've ever known working my ass off every single day performing  creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day  i come from a long bloodline of female activists my aunt judy was the first italian american female president of the national press club in washington dc i think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled after black power women's liberation and 46 years later we're still not quite there yet if a women has a lot of sex or any sex for that matter she's a slut if a man has sex he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used bitcheshoes how lovely he's had he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated  celebrated aww shiiit he smashed  i know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating  married to  attached to having sex with or not  seen with but by their value as an individual  i want the people reading this to know that they are more than enough on their own i want the media to please help me with this please support each other i'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like i constantly had to have a boy by my side after being on my own now for a few months i am realizing that that's just not the case i have never felt more present grounded and satisfied i've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more  one more thought my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as i can with my fans that is something i have done since day one and never plan on changing it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny special personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things i've done  things i'm going through i don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before i love y'all with all my heart you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me  any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke she will need her sisterhood  gloria steinem

narration beyoncé  i sometimes wish i could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else before i was famous i was the girl on the heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life

we need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality it isnt a reality yet today women make up half of the us workforce but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable things will not change men have to demand that their wives daughters mothers and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters we must demand that we all receive 00 percent of the opportunities

there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message

i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today

we are sick and tired of the killings of young men and women in our communities  it is up to us to take a stand and demand that they stop killing us  we don't need sympathy we need everyone to respect our lives  we're going to stand up as a community and fight against anyone who believes that murder or any violent action by those who are sworn to protect us should consistently go unpunished  these robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation for the next young men and women who believe in good  this is a human fight no matter your race gender or sexual orientation this is a fight for anyone who feels marginalized who is struggling for freedom and human rights  this is not a plea to all police officers but toward any human being who fails to value life the war on people of color and all minorities needs to be over  fear is not an excuse hate will not win  we all have the power to channel our anger and frustration into action we must use our voices to contact the politicians and legislators in our districts and demand social and judicial changes  while we pray for the families of alton sterling and philando castile we will also pray for an end to this plague of injustice in our communities  click in to contact the politicians and legislators in your area your voice will be heard  beyoncé


verse when you wish upon a star makes no difference who you are anything your heart desires will come to you if your heart is in your dream no request is too extreme when you wish upon a star as dreamers do

if i were a boy even just for a day i'd roll outta bed in the morning and throw on what i wanted and go drink beer with the guys and chase after girls id kick it with who i wanted and i'd never get confronted for it cause they'd stick up for me  if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear id be a better man i'd listen to her cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed  if i were a boy i would turn off my phone tell everyone it's broken so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone i'd put myself first and make the rules as i go cause i know that she'd be faithful waitin for me to come home to come home  if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear id be a better man i'd listen to her cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted cause hes taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed  it's a little too late for you to come back say it's just a mistake think i'd forgive you like that if you thought i would wait for you you thought wrong  but youre just a boy you don't understand yeah you don't understand how it feels to love a girl someday you wish you were a better man you don't listen to her you don't care how it hurts until you lose the one you wanted cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy  i want you to know that i'm happy for you i wish nothing but the best for you both an older version of me is she perverted like me would she go down on you in a theatre does she speak eloquently and would she have your baby i'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide no and every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'til you died but you're still alive   and i'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away it's not fair to deny me of the cross i bear that you gave to me you you you oughta know you seem very well things look peaceful i'm not quite as well i thought you should know did you forget about me mr duplicity i hate to bug you in the middle of dinner it was a slap in the face how quickly i was replaced are you thinking of me when you fuck her cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide no and every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'til you died but you're still alive   and i'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away it's not fair to deny me of the cross i bear that you gave to me you you you oughta know  but you're just a boy yeah you don't understand until you lose the one you wanted cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy

narration beyoncé  i sometimes wish i could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else before i was famous i was the girl on the heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life

we need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality it isnt a reality yet today women make up half of the us workforce but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable things will not change men have to demand that their wives daughters mothers and sisters earn more commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters we must demand that we all receive 00 percent of the opportunities

there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message

i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today

we are sick and tired of the killings of young men and women in our communities  it is up to us to take a stand and demand that they stop killing us  we don't need sympathy we need everyone to respect our lives  we're going to stand up as a community and fight against anyone who believes that murder or any violent action by those who are sworn to protect us should consistently go unpunished  these robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation for the next young men and women who believe in good  this is a human fight no matter your race gender or sexual orientation this is a fight for anyone who feels marginalized who is struggling for freedom and human rights  this is not a plea to all police officers but toward any human being who fails to value life the war on people of color and all minorities needs to be over  fear is not an excuse hate will not win  we all have the power to channel our anger and frustration into action we must use our voices to contact the politicians and legislators in our districts and demand social and judicial changes  while we pray for the families of alton sterling and philando castile we will also pray for an end to this plague of injustice in our communities  click in to contact the politicians and legislators in your area your voice will be heard  beyoncé


verse when you wish upon a star makes no difference who you are anything your heart desires will come to you if your heart is in your dream no request is too extreme when you wish upon a star as dreamers do

if i were a boy even just for a day i'd roll outta bed in the morning and throw on what i wanted and go drink beer with the guys and chase after girls id kick it with who i wanted and i'd never get confronted for it cause they'd stick up for me  if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear id be a better man i'd listen to her cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed  if i were a boy i would turn off my phone tell everyone it's broken so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone i'd put myself first and make the rules as i go cause i know that she'd be faithful waitin for me to come home to come home  if i were a boy i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear id be a better man i'd listen to her cause i know how it hurts when you lose the one you wanted cause hes taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed  it's a little too late for you to come back say it's just a mistake think i'd forgive you like that if you thought i would wait for you you thought wrong  but youre just a boy you don't understand yeah you don't understand how it feels to love a girl someday you wish you were a better man you don't listen to her you don't care how it hurts until you lose the one you wanted cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy  i want you to know that i'm happy for you i wish nothing but the best for you both an older version of me is she perverted like me would she go down on you in a theatre does she speak eloquently and would she have your baby i'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide no and every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'til you died but you're still alive   and i'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away it's not fair to deny me of the cross i bear that you gave to me you you you oughta know you seem very well things look peaceful i'm not quite as well i thought you should know did you forget about me mr duplicity i hate to bug you in the middle of dinner it was a slap in the face how quickly i was replaced are you thinking of me when you fuck her cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide no and every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'til you died but you're still alive   and i'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away it's not fair to deny me of the cross i bear that you gave to me you you you oughta know  but you're just a boy yeah you don't understand until you lose the one you wanted cause you've taken her for granted and everything you have got destroyed but you're just a boy

i should ink my skin with your name and take my passport out again and just replace it see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle and i should run you a hot bath fill it up with bubbles 'cause maybe you're loveable maybe you're my snowflake and your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  hook and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up   and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrek 'cause we've watched it  times and maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too and if your dvd breaks today you should've got a vcr because i've never owned a bluray true say i know i've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i'm gonna be home next week and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  hook and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up   and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so ill take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i'll carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now against yours now cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up maybe i fell in love when you woke me up


it's just another night and i'm staring at the moon i saw a shooting star and thought of you i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew if you were here i'd sing to you you're on the other side as the skyline splits in two i'm miles away from seeing you but i can see the stars from america i wondered do you see them too   so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home   i can hear your heart on the radio beat they're playing chasing cars and i thought of us back to the time you were lying next to me i looked across and fell in love so i took your hand back through lamp lit streets i knew everything led back to you so can you see the stars over amsterdam you're the song my heart is beating to   so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home   and oh i know and oh i know and oh i can see the stars from america


now i don't wanna hate you just wish you'd never gone for the man and waited two weeks at least before you let him take you i stayed true i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he's waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he's not the right guy for you don't hate me 'cause i write the truth no i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but fuck it i won't be changing the subject i love it i'll make your little secret public it's nothing i'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i'm lacking sleep fact is you're mad at me because i backtrack so casually you're practically my family if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot i think not   i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore   recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i'm away so much i stay more celibate than in a monastery i'm not cut out for life on the road 'cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much and at the time we'd just go so sue me i guess i'm not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that's when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it's hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i'll ever have and need i guess i'm unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with   i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore   and since you left i've given up my days off it's what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 47 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook 'cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career in music didn't exist in 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill and i'd be writing my will before i'm 7 i'll die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing alice it's only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i'll be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i'm not prepared but i'll say this these things happen for a reason and you can't change shit take my apology i'm sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest   i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore

i was born inside a small town i've lost that state of mind learned to sing inside the lord's house but stopped at the age of nine i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride and when the world's against me is when i really come alive and every day that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride you know that i've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up instead i look in the mirror questioning what i've become i guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me without a ninetofive job or a uni degree to be caught up in the trappings of the industry they showed me the locked doors i find another use of key and you'll see    i'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me but with that said give me one more higher another one to take the sting away i am happy on my own so here i'll stay save your lovin' arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser   i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs i chased the picture perfect life i think they painted it wrong i think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps because you're living your dream man this shit should be fun please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run i beg you don't be disappointed with the man i've become our conversations with my father on the a4 age twelve telling me i've gotta chase those dreams now i'm playing for the people dad and they know me with my beat and small  wearing the same old jeans wembley stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou i may have grown up but i hope that damien's proud and to the next generation inspiration's allowed the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow    i'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me but with that said give me one more higher another one to take the sting away i am happy on my own so here i'll stay save your lovin' arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser and i'll

when she fell she fell apart cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fairweather friends  when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices echoes she heard even in her sleep whatever you say it is not right whatever you do it is not enough your kindness is fake your pain is manipulative  when she lay there on the ground she dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she finally rose she rose slowly avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies wary of phone calls and promises charmers dandies and getlovequickschemes  when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck bathed in her brokenness said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed standing broadshouldered next to her was a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she turned to go home she heard the echoes of new words may your heart remain breakable but never by the same hand twice and even louder without your past you could never have arrived so wondrously and brutally by design or some violent exquisite happenstance here  and in the death of her reputation she felt truly alive

here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation

took a deep breath in the mirror he didn't like it when i wore high heels but i do turn the lock and put my headphones on he always said he didn't get this song but i do i do walked in expecting you'd be late but you got here early and you stand and wave i walk to you you pull my chair out and help me in and you don't know how nice that is but i do   and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again   you said you never met one girl who had as many james taylor records as you but i do we tell stories and you don't know why i'm coming off a little shy but i do   but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again   and we walked down the block to my car and i almost brought him up but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches every single christmas and i want to talk about that and for the first time what's past is past   'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again   but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again


i still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at 58 the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away away   i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july 9th the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms   but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips   i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party you're showing off again and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in i'm not much for dancing but for you i did  4 because i love your handshake meeting my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions   and i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss i never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips ooh   so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it's nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind   so i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips   just like our last

i was reminiscing just the other day while having coffee all alone and lord it took me away back to a firstglance feeling on new york time back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme took off faster than a green light go hey you skip the conversation when you already know i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made and that was the first day   and darling it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground   spinning like a girl in a brand new dress we had this big wide city all to ourselves we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you and for the first time i had something to lose and i guess we fell apart in the usual way and the story's got dust on every page but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now and i see your face in every crowd   'cause darling it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground   tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in this room but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you   it was good never looking down and right there where we stood was holy ground   tonight i'm gonna dance for all that we've been through but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you tonight i'm gonna dance like you were in this room but i don't wanna dance if i'm not dancing with you

i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl   i sneak in and see your friends and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel and she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry  pre this is surely not what you thought it would be i lose myself in a daydream where i stand and say   don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now   fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march and i am hiding in the curtains it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe  pre she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen but i know you wish it was me you wish it was me don't you   don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now   don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow your time is running out and they said speak now  interlude ooh ladadada oh ooh ooh say a single vow   i hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace there's the silence there's my last chance i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me horrified looks from everyone in the room but i'm only looking at you   i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl hehe   so don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now    variation and you say let's run away now i'll meet you when i'm out of my tux at the back door baby i didn't say my vows so glad you were around when they said speak now


i think i think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes you know it's like a kaleidoscope of memories it just all comes back but he never does i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen it's not really anything he said or anything he did it was the feeling that came along with it and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again but i don't know if i should i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright but i just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you maybe he knew that when he saw me i guess i just lost my balance i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him it was losing me

when she fell she fell apart cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fairweather friends  when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices echoes she heard even in her sleep whatever you say it is not right whatever you do it is not enough your kindness is fake your pain is manipulative  when she lay there on the ground she dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she finally rose she rose slowly avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies wary of phone calls and promises charmers dandies and getlovequickschemes  when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck bathed in her brokenness said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed standing broadshouldered next to her was a love that was really something not just the idea of something  when she turned to go home she heard the echoes of new words may your heart remain breakable but never by the same hand twice and even louder without your past you could never have arrived so wondrously and brutally by design or some violent exquisite happenstance here  and in the death of her reputation she felt truly alive

here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation


if you're anything like me you bite your nails and laugh when you're nervous you promise people the world because that's what they want from you you like giving them what they want but darling you need to stop  if you're anything like me you knock on wood every time you make plans you cross your fingers hold your breath wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck rest in peace to your naive bravado if life gets too good now darling it scares you  if you're anything like me you never wanted to lock your door your secret garden gate or your diary drawer didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore for fear she was much better before but darling now you have to  if you're anything like me there's a justice system in your head for names you'll never speak again and you make your ruthless rulings each new enemy turns to steel they become the bars that confine you in your own little golden prison cell but darling there is where you meet yourself  if you're anything like me you've grown to hate your pride to love your thighs and no amount of friends at 5 will fill the empty seats at the lunch tables of your past the teams that picked you last but darling you keep trying  if you're anything like me you couldn't recognize the face of your love until they stripped you of your shiny paint threw your victory flag away and you saw the ones who wanted you anyway darling later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day  if you're anything like me i'm sorry  but darling it's going to be okay

took a deep breath in the mirror he didn't like it when i wore high heels but i do turn the lock and put my headphones on he always said he didn't get this song but i do i do walked in expecting you'd be late but you got here early and you stand and wave i walk to you you pull my chair out and help me in and you don't know how nice that is but i do   and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again   you said you never met one girl who had as many james taylor records as you but i do we tell stories and you don't know why i'm coming off a little shy but i do   but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again   and we walked down the block to my car and i almost brought him up but you start to talk about the movies that your family watches every single christmas and i want to talk about that and for the first time what's past is past   'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did i've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again   but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again


i still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at 58 the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away away   i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july 9th the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms   but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips   i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party you're showing off again and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in i'm not much for dancing but for you i did  4 because i love your handshake meeting my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions   and i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss i never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips ooh   so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it's nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind   so i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips   just like our last

i said remember this moment in the back of my mind the time we stood with our shaking hands the crowds in stands went wild we were the kings and the queens and they read off our names the night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same you held your head like a hero on a history book page it was the end of a decade but the start of an age   long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered   i said remember this feeling i passed the pictures around of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines wishing for right now we are the kings and the queens you traded your baseball cap for a crown when they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town and the cynics were outraged screaming this is absurd 'cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world   long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i'm not afraid long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you i was screaming long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered   hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall  breakdown will you take a moment promise me this that you'll stand by me forever but if god forbid fate should step in and force us into a goodbye if you have children some day when they point to the pictures please tell them my name tell them how the crowds went wild tell them how i hope they shine long live the walls we crashed through i had the time of my life with you   long long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i'm not afraid singing long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you and long long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered

i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl   i sneak in and see your friends and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel and she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry  pre this is surely not what you thought it would be i lose myself in a daydream where i stand and say   don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now   fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march and i am hiding in the curtains it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe  pre she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen but i know you wish it was me you wish it was me don't you   don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now   don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow your time is running out and they said speak now  interlude ooh ladadada oh ooh ooh say a single vow   i hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace there's the silence there's my last chance i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me horrified looks from everyone in the room but i'm only looking at you   i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl hehe   so don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now    variation and you say let's run away now i'll meet you when i'm out of my tux at the back door baby i didn't say my vows so glad you were around when they said speak now


i think i think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes you know it's like a kaleidoscope of memories it just all comes back but he never does i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen it's not really anything he said or anything he did it was the feeling that came along with it and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again but i don't know if i should i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright but i just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you maybe he knew that when he saw me i guess i just lost my balance i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him it was losing me

last night i heard my own heart beating sounded like footsteps on my stairs six months gone and i'm still reaching even though i know you're not there i was playing back a thousand memories baby thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through maybe i've been going back too much lately when time stood still and i had you   come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now   i know people change and these things happen but i remember how it was back then wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing 'cause nothing like this ever happened to them now i'm pacing down the hall chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me nothing's gonna change not for me and you not before i knew how much i had to lose   come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now   if you're out there if you're somewhere if you're moving on i've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone i just want it back the way it was before and i just want to see you back at my front door    variation and i say come back come back come back to me like you would before you said it's not that easy before the fight before i locked you out but i take it all back now   come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now   you'd be here by now it's not the kind of ending you want to see now baby what about the ending oh i thought you'd be here by now thought you'd be here by now
